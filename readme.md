>## **CLI Syntax & Cmdlets**<br>
>
>>### **Syntax**<br>
>>
>>_**To make the CLI commands parseable, they must be syntactically correct:**_  
>>CLI command arguments must always be separated by a single space,  
>>and must never have any trailing spaces:  
>>`newUser john 3`  
>>
>>User or door names must be either snake_case or camelCase:  
>>`rmUser johnDoe`  
>>`rmUser john_doe`  
>>The CLI parser will look for both and ensure all entries are removed.  
>>
>>If exceptions are made such as PascalCase or PascalSnake_Case,  
>>it will still work as long as the preceding letter to a surname is lower case:  
>>`rmDoor JohnDoe`  
>>`rmDoor John_Doe`  
>>`rmDoor JOHN_Doe`  
>> 
>>The following combinations will not work:  
>>`newUser JOHNDOE`  
>>`newUser johNdoe`  
>
>>### **Cmdlets**<br>
>>
>>- Add a new door by name: `newDoor <string>door1 <int>accesslevel`
>>- Create a new user: `newUser <string>0gga <int>accesslevel`
>>- Remove an existing user: `rmDoor <string>door1`
>>- Remove an existing user: `rmUser <string>0gga`
>>- Shutdown the CLI connection: `shutdown`
>>- Get client logs: `getLog`
>>
>>
>>#### **Possible additions:**
>>
>>- Get user specific logs: `getULog 0gga`

>## **Compilation**<br>
>>### **Cross Compilation**<br>
>>CMake is used for compilation and works well with any toolchain.  
>>Use CLion WSL toolchain for easy cross compilation.

>## **Features**<br>
>>### **Implemented**<br>
>>- Easy Admin configuration through CLI connection on a separate port.
>>- Constantly accepts clients and stores information independently.  
>>- Systemwide unified users.json - read onto hashmaps at startup for efficient runtime.
>>- String parser for standardized name format - snake_case.  
>><br>
>>- ASIO - Asynchronous client handling.  
>>- Asynchronous client handling runs on hardcoded amount of dedicated threads{4}.  
>>- Callback to avoid blocking IO.  
>><br>
>>- OOP for simple high-level usage.
> 
>>### **To be implemented**<br>
>>- The system currently doesn't write systemwide logs nor user logs.
>>- Client names, for readable logging.
>>- Client basis Access Levels.
